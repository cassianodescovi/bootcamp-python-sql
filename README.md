# Python and SQL Bootcamp

Welcome to the Python and SQL Bootcamp! This repository is designed to take you through the fundamentals of Python, Git, and SQL. It contains a series of exercises and a final project that incorporates CRUD operations, FastAPI, Postgres, and Streamlit. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started in the world of programming or an experienced developer aiming to brush up on your skills, this bootcamp has something for everyone.

## Overview

The bootcamp is structured into 20 classes, each contained in its own directory (`class01`, `class02`, ..., `class20`). The first 19 classes are exercises that cover the basics of Python programming, the essentials of Git for version control, and the foundations of SQL for database management. The 20th class is a comprehensive project that brings all these elements together, showcasing how to build and deploy a real-world application.

### What You Will Learn

- **Python Basics:** Variables, control structures, data structures, functions, and modules.
- **Git Essentials:** Repository setup, version control basics, branching, and collaboration.
- **SQL Foundations:** Database design, basic queries, advanced SQL features, and data manipulation.
- **Project Implementation:** CRUD operations, API development with FastAPI, database integration with Postgres, and interactive web applications with Streamlit.

## Prerequisites
