# Class 05 - Functions and Sales Analysis Challenge

Welcome to Class 05 of our Python and SQL Bootcamp! This session is dedicated to deepening your understanding of functions in Python and applying this knowledge to a practical challenge: analyzing product sales data from a CSV file.

## Overview

Functions are a fundamental concept in Python, allowing for code reusability and better organization. This class will teach you how to define and use functions to make your code more modular, maintainable, and testable.

### Objective

The main challenge for this class is to perform a sales analysis of product data. Given a CSV file containing sales data for various products, you are tasked with reading the data, processing it into a dictionary for easier analysis, and then calculating and reporting the total sales by product category.

## Exercises

### Sales Analysis Challenge

Your challenge consists of the following steps:

1. **Read Sales Data**: Implement a function to read sales data from a CSV file. Each row contains details about a single product sale, including the product category.

2. **Process Data**: Develop a function to process the read data into a dictionary. This dictionary should organize sales data by product category, making it easier to analyze.

3. **Calculate Total Sales**: Create a function to calculate the total sales for each category. This involves summing up the sales amounts or quantities sold per category.

4. **Report Sales**: Finally, implement a function to report the total sales by category. This could be a simple printout or a more complex report format, depending on your preference.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have a CSV file with sales data structured appropriately (e.g., `product_name`, `category`, `amount_sold`, etc.). Then, follow the steps outlined in the challenge, implementing each part as a separate function in your Python script.

## Bonus Challenge

As a bonus challenge, try extending your program with additional features, such as:
- Filtering sales data by date range.
- Identifying the best-selling product in each category.
- Generating a pie chart to visually represent sales by category using a library like Matplotlib.

## Conclusion

By the end of this class, you'll have applied Python functions to a real-world problem, enhancing your problem-solving and data analysis skills. This challenge not only reinforces your understanding of functions but also gives you hands-on experience with data processing and analysis in Python.

Happy coding!
