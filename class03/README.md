# Class 03 - Debugging and Control Flow in Python

Welcome to Class 03 of our Python and SQL Bootcamp! This class dives into essential programming concepts that are critical for developing complex applications: debugging, conditional statements (`if`), and looping constructs (`for`, `while`).

## Overview

In this session, we'll cover:
- **Debugging:** Techniques and tools to identify and fix errors in your code. We'll discuss common types of errors you'll encounter in Python and how to use print statements and IDE features to track them down.
- **Conditional Statements (`if`):** Learn how to execute code blocks based on certain conditions. This includes understanding `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks and how they control the flow of your program.
- **Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`):** Discover how to efficiently repeat tasks and process sequences (like lists or strings) using `for` loops, and how to execute code blocks as long as a condition remains true with `while` loops.

## Exercises

You'll apply what you've learned by tackling several coding challenges:
1. **Debugging Practice:** Identify and fix bugs in a provided snippet of code.
2. **Conditional Logic:** Implement a program that takes user input and uses conditional statements to respond to various inputs differently.
3. **Looping Through Data:** Create a script that processes a list of items, performing different actions based on the type or value of each item.
4. **While Loop Application:** Utilize a `while` loop to implement a guessing game or another repetitive task that should continue until a specific condition is met.

## Tips for Success
- Pay close attention to error messages when debugging; they often provide valuable hints about what's wrong.
- Use `print()` statements to display variable values at different points in your code, helping you understand how data changes during execution.
- Think carefully about the conditions you set for `if` and `while` statements to prevent infinite loops or logic errors.

## Bonus Challenge

Combine all the concepts from this class to create a small text-based game or utility. This could involve taking user commands, processing them with conditional logic, and using loops to manage the game state or repeat tasks.

Happy coding, and remember: debugging is a crucial skill for any developer, as understanding and fixing errors is key to improving your code!
