# Class 01 - Introduction to Python Basics

Welcome to the first class of our Python and SQL Bootcamp! This session is designed to introduce you to the basics of programming in Python, focusing on variables, basic data types, and simple input/output operations.

## Overview

In this class, you will learn how to:
- Declare variables and understand Python's dynamic typing.
- Perform basic operations with numbers and strings.
- Use the `input` function to capture user input.
- Convert between different data types, specifically to and from floating-point numbers.
- Handle basic arithmetic operations and construct simple formulas.

## Exercise

Your task is to create a simple program that:
1. Asks the user for their name, salary, and a bonus amount.
2. Calculates a final bonus value by adding a predefined constant bonus to the product of the salary and the user bonus percentage.
3. Outputs a customized message to the user with their name and the calculated bonus.

This exercise will test your understanding of user input, type conversion, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## Bonus Challenge

Identify potential bugs and risks in the provided program and consider how you might handle incorrect user inputs or other errors gracefully.

Good luck, and enjoy your coding journey!
