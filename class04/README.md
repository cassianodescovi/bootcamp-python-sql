# Class 04 - Type Hinting and Complex Types in Python

Welcome to Class 04 of our Python and SQL Bootcamp! This class explores the concept of type hinting in Python, as well as complex data types, with a focus on dictionaries, DataFrames, tables, and how they relate to Excel sheets. By understanding these concepts, you'll be better equipped to handle and manipulate data in your Python programs.

## Overview

In this session, we cover:
- **Type Hinting:** An introduction to type hints in Python, which are a means of explicitly indicating the expected data type of a variable or return value of a function. This is useful for code readability and can help with debugging.
- **Complex Data Types:** We delve into more complex data structures such as dictionaries and how they compare to DataFrames in libraries like pandas, tables in databases, and spreadsheets in Excel. Understanding these similarities and differences is crucial for data manipulation and analysis.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Type Checking and Validation

In this exercise, you implement a series of checks to validate user input for a name, salary, and bonus. This involves using type hints to ensure that variables are of the correct type, as well as employing `while` loops and `try-except` blocks to catch and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

Key concepts applied:
- Type hinting for variables.
- Using loops to repeatedly prompt for input until valid data is received.
- Exception handling to catch and respond to invalid inputs.

### Exercise 2: Reading Data from CSV

This exercise introduces you to reading data from a CSV file using Python's built-in `csv` module. You'll learn how to open a file, read its contents into a list of dictionaries, and iterate over those dictionaries to access and print the data.

Key concepts applied:
- Working with the `csv` module to read from CSV files.
- Managing file context with `with` statement ensuring proper handling of file resources.
- Data manipulation and iteration over complex data structures like lists and dictionaries.

## Recap

Today's class has equipped you with knowledge on type hinting and working with complex data types in Python. These skills are foundational for writing clear, robust, and maintainable code in your future projects.

## Next Steps

Practice these concepts by experimenting with different types of complex data structures and implementing type hints in your code. Try extending the exercises with additional functionality, like writing data to a CSV file or applying more complex data validation rules.

Happy coding!
